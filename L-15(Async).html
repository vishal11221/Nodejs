    <p>Difference between Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming Language ? <br>
       Asynchronous Programming language not wait for other task,if any program stuck it move to other one that why Asynchronous programming language are faster as compare to Synchronous programming language.Like:- Javascript,Nodejs are Asynchronous Programming language.While Synchronous Programming language waiting for execution that's why it slow like php language</p>

       <p>Disadvantage of Asynchronous language:- <br>
          When we declare a and b and from function we set timeout to update the value of b like 2second and also we console a+b then the result is initilize value only,it not update the value of b and add that is drawback of Asynchronous language.</p>
