    <p>What is the Difference between Static and Dynamic page ? <br>
       When in our web-page all content display from your internal-files that means these files are in your project directory that are static files.When our all content that are showing in web-page come from database that are dynamic page.For example you have profile page and in that profile page,your name,your profile image,forms data show and that all data come from database then it is Dynamic page or that data is dynamic data, if all data come from some external file then it is static page or that data is static data.</p>
